### ----------- US Household Income Analysis Project -----------
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on analyzing US household income data. The project involves extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data using SQL, cleaning the dataset by handling duplicates and missing values, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, and visualizing insights using Tableau.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze US household income data to derive insights and trends. The project uses SQL for data manipulation tasks, including ETL processes, data cleaning, and initial analysis. Tableau is used for visualizing the cleaned dataset and presenting key findings.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains information on US household income. It includes various attributes such as income statistics, demographic information, and geographical data.
https://www.census.gov/

# Tools and Technologies Used
SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, cleaning, and initial analysis.
Tableau: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
GitHub: Repository hosting and version control for project code and documentation.

# Project Structure
data/: Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.
scripts/: SQL scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and EDA.
tableau/: Tableau workbook and visualization files.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.

# Key Steps
1.Data Extraction: The dataset was extracted from (https://www.census.gov/).
Data Cleaning: Duplicate records and missing values were handled using SQL queries. Generated missing values were based on [similarities in the data set & in some cases averages].

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various SQL queries were used to perform exploratory analysis on the dataset, investigating most and least rich cities, distributions, and geographical correlations.

3.Visualization with Tableau: The cleaned dataset was visualized using Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

# Usage
To replicate this analysis:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/us-household-income-analysis.git
Set up your SQL environment and database.
Run the SQL scripts in the scripts/ directory to execute the data cleaning and analysis tasks.
Open the Tableau workbook in the tableau/ directory to explore the visualizations.

# Results
The analysis provided insights into US household income trends and distributions. Results are summarized in the project documentation and visualized using Tableau dashboards.
